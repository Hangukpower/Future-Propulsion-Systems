R-7 Semyorka (1950s, Russia): The world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and the first rocket to reach space. Had a maximum payload capacity of approximately 5.5 metric tons. 

Saturn V (1960s, USA): The rocket used during the Apollo program to send astronauts to the moon. Stood 111 meters tall, weighed 2.8 million kg, and had a maximum payload capacity of 140 metric tons. 

Energia (1970s, Russia): A Soviet heavy-lift launch vehicle designed to carry payloads of up to 100 metric tons to low Earth orbit. Stood 60 meters tall and weighed 2.4 million kg. 

Space Shuttle (1980s, USA): While not technically a rocket, the Space Shuttle was the world's first operational reusable spacecraft. It was capable of carrying up to 24.5 metric tons of cargo into low Earth orbit. 

Delta IV (1990s, USA): A family of expendable rockets designed for commercial and government launches. The Delta IV Heavy variant can carry up to 28.8 metric tons to low Earth orbit. Falcon 9 (2000s, USA): A partially reusable rocket developed by SpaceX, designed for low Earth orbit and beyond. Has a maximum payload capacity of 22.8 metric tons to low Earth orbit. 

Falcon Heavy (2010s, USA): A heavy-lift launch vehicle developed by SpaceX, capable of lifting 63.8 metric tons to low Earth orbit. Stands 70 meters tall and weighs 1.4 million kg. 

Space Launch System (2020s, USA): A heavy-lift launch vehicle currently under development by NASA. Expected to have a maximum payload capacity of 130 metric tons to low Earth orbit. Stands 98 meters tall and weighs over 2.9 million kg.

One of the most important mathematical concepts in space travel is orbital mechanics. This involves the use of calculus and differential equations to model the motion of objects in space, taking into account the gravitational forces of the planets and other celestial bodies.

To travel to a planet in our solar system, a spacecraft must first be launched from Earth and placed into orbit around the Sun. From there, it can be maneuvered into a trajectory that will bring it close to the target planet.

This trajectory can be calculated using a technique called the "Hohmann transfer orbit," which involves calculating the minimum energy path between two celestial bodies. This requires solving a set of equations that take into account the masses and positions of the two bodies, as well as the speed and direction of the spacecraft.

Once the spacecraft reaches the target planet, it must be slowed down using a process called "orbital insertion." This involves carefully timing the spacecraft's trajectory and firing its engines to slow down enough to enter orbit around the planet.

Overall, space travel involves a complex set of mathematical calculations and engineering challenges that require careful planning and precise execution. While we currently have the technology to travel to the planets in our solar system, future advancements in space technology could one day make travel to other star systems a possibility.
